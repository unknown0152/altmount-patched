# Common Issues and Solutions

This guide covers the most frequently encountered issues with AltMount and their solutions, organized by category for quick diagnosis and resolution.

## Installation Issues

### Binary Won't Start

#### Symptoms

```
./altmount: permission denied
```

or

```
./altmount: cannot execute binary file
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Fix Permissions**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x altmount
   ```

2. **Check Architecture**: Ensure you downloaded the correct binary for your system:

   ```bash
   # Check your architecture
   uname -m

   # x86_64 -> use amd64 binary
   # aarch64 -> use arm64 binary
   ```

3. **Verify File Integrity**:

   ```bash
   # Check if file is corrupted
   file altmount

   # Should show: ELF 64-bit LSB executable...
   ```

   # Run from directory containing config.yaml
   cd /path/to/altmount/config
   ./altmount serve
   ```

### Docker Container Won't Start

#### Symptoms

```
docker: Error response from daemon: invalid mount config
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Create Required Directories**:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ./config ./metadata
   ```

2. **Fix Volume Permissions**:

   ```bash
   # Set correct ownership
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./config ./metadata
   ```

3. **Check Docker Compose**:
   ```yaml
   # Ensure proper volume syntax
   volumes:
     - ./config:/config
     - ./metadata:/metadata
   ```

## Connection Issues

### NNTP Provider Connection Failed

#### Symptoms

```
ERROR Provider "primary": connection failed: dial tcp: i/o timeout
```

**Diagnosis Steps:**

1. **Test Network Connectivity**:

   ```bash
   # Test provider reachability
   telnet ssl-news.provider.com 563

   # Check DNS resolution
   nslookup ssl-news.provider.com
   ```

2. **Verify Credentials**:

   ```bash
   # Check provider account status on their website
   # Ensure username/password are correct in config
   ```

3. **Check Firewall/ISP Blocking**:
   ```bash
   # Test different ports
   telnet provider.com 119  # Try non-SSL port
   telnet provider.com 563  # Try SSL port
   ```

**Solutions:**

1. **Correct Provider Settings**:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - host: "correct-hostname.provider.com" # Verify hostname
       port: 563 # Use correct port
       username: "correct_username" # Check case sensitivity
       password: "correct_password" # Check special characters
       tls: true # Enable SSL if supported
   ```

2. **Try Alternative Endpoints**:

   ```yaml
   # Many providers offer multiple endpoints
   host: "ssl-eu.provider.com"     # European endpoint
   # or
   host: "ssl-us.provider.com"     # US endpoint
   ```

3. **Adjust Connection Limits**:
   ```yaml
   providers:
     - host: "provider.com"
       max_connections: 10 # Reduce if getting rejected
       # ... other settings
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: AltMount logs showing successful provider connections after troubleshooting]_

### WebDAV Cannot Be Accessed

#### Symptoms

- Browser shows "This site can't be reached"
- WebDAV clients show connection errors
- curl fails with connection refused

**Diagnosis:**

1. **Check AltMount Status**:

   ```bash
   # Verify AltMount is running
   ps aux | grep altmount

   # Check if port is listening
   netstat -ln | grep 8080
   # or
   ss -ln | grep 8080
   ```

2. **Test Local Access**:

   ```bash
   # Test from same machine
   curl http://localhost:8080/

   # Should return WebDAV response
   ```

3. **Check Network Access**:
   ```bash
   # Test from remote machine
   curl http://altmount-server-ip:8080/
   ```

**Solutions:**

1. **Firewall Configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Ubuntu/Debian
   sudo ufw allow 8080

   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo firewall-cmd --add-port=8080/tcp --permanent
   sudo firewall-cmd --reload

   # Check iptables
   sudo iptables -L | grep 8080
   ```

2. **Network Interface Binding**:

   ```yaml
   # If running in Docker, ensure proper port mapping
   ports:
     - "8080:8080"
   # For CLI, AltMount binds to all interfaces by default
   ```

3. **Router/NAT Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # For external access, configure port forwarding
   # Router settings: External Port 8080 -> Internal IP:8080
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: Network diagnostic tools showing successful connections to AltMount WebDAV server]_

## Authentication Issues

### WebDAV Authentication Failures

#### Symptoms

```
401 Unauthorized
```

or

```
HTTP Basic: Access denied
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify Credentials**:

   ```yaml
   webdav:
     user: "correct_username" # Check case sensitivity
     password: "correct_password" # Check special characters
   ```

2. **Test Without Authentication**:

   ```yaml
   webdav:
     port: 8080
     # Remove user and password temporarily
   ```

3. **URL Encoding Issues**:

   ```bash
   # If password has special characters, URL encode them
   # @ becomes %40, & becomes %26, etc.
   curl http://user:p%40ssw0rd@localhost:8080/
   ```

4. **Client-Specific Issues**:

   ```bash
   # Windows WebDAV client issues
   # May need registry changes for HTTP (vs HTTPS)

   # Try alternative clients like WinSCP or Cyberduck
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: WebDAV client successfully connecting after authentication fix]_

## Performance Issues

### Slow Download Speeds

#### Symptoms

- Downloads significantly slower than expected
- Streaming buffers frequently
- High latency in file operations

**Diagnosis:**

1. **Check Provider Performance**:

   ```bash
   # Check provider connection utilization
   curl -u user:pass http://localhost:8080/api/providers
   ```

2. **Monitor System Resources**:

   ```bash
   # Check CPU and memory usage
   top
   htop

   # Check disk I/O
   iotop
   iostat -x 1
   ```

3. **Network Analysis**:

   ```bash
   # Check bandwidth usage
   iftop
   nethogs

   # Test provider speed directly
   wget --user=username --password=password \
        ftp://provider.com/test-file.bin
   ```

**Solutions:**

1. **Optimize Streaming Settings**:

   ```yaml
   streaming:
     max_prefetch: 45 # Increase prefetch for better throughput
   ```

2. **Provider Optimization**:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - host: "fastest-endpoint.com" # Use fastest endpoint
       max_connections: 30 # Increase if provider allows
       tls: true
   ```

3. **System Optimization**:

   ```bash
   # Use faster storage for metadata
   # Move metadata to SSD if using HDD

   # Increase network buffers (Linux)
   echo 'net.core.rmem_max = 16777216' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
   echo 'net.core.wmem_max = 16777216' >> /etc/sysctl.conf
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: Performance monitoring dashboard showing improved speeds after optimization]_

### High Memory Usage

#### Symptoms

- AltMount using excessive memory
- System becomes unresponsive
- Out of memory errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Reduce Memory Settings**:

   ```yaml
   streaming:
     max_prefetch: 10 # Lower prefetch to reduce memory usage
   ```

2. **Monitor Memory Leaks**:

   ```bash
   # Monitor AltMount memory usage over time
   watch -n 5 'ps aux | grep altmount'

   # Check for gradual increases indicating leaks
   ```

3. **System Configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Increase swap space if needed
   sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
   sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
   sudo mkswap /swapfile
   sudo swapon /swapfile
   ```

## File Access Issues

### Files Appear Empty or Corrupted

#### Symptoms

- Files show correct size but won't open
- Media files won't play
- Partial file downloads

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Provider Availability**:

   ```bash
   # Verify providers are connected and working
   curl -u user:pass http://localhost:8080/api/health/providers
   ```

2. **Test Different Files**:

   ```bash
   # Try accessing different files to isolate the issue
   # Check if problem is specific to certain content
   ```

3. **Clear Metadata Cache**:

   ```bash
   # Stop AltMount
   ./altmount stop

   # Clear metadata cache (backup first!)
   cp -r metadata metadata.backup
   rm -rf metadata/*

   # Restart AltMount
   ./altmount serve
   ```

4. **Enable Auto-Repair**:

   ```yaml
   health:
     enabled: true

   arrs:
     enabled: true
     # Configure ARR instances — auto-repair activates automatically
     # when ARR integration is enabled and configured
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: File verification process showing corrupt file detection and repair initiation]_

### Permission Denied on Files

#### Symptoms

```
Permission denied
```

or

```
403 Forbidden
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check File Permissions**:

   ```bash
   # Check metadata directory permissions
   ls -la metadata/

   # Fix ownership if needed
   sudo chown -R altmount:altmount metadata/
   ```

2. **Docker Permission Issues**:

   ```yaml
   # Ensure PUID/PGID match host user
   environment:
     - PUID=1000
     - PGID=1000

   # Fix volume permissions
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./config ./metadata
   ```

3. **WebDAV Authentication**:
   ```bash
   # Verify WebDAV credentials are correct
   curl -u username:password http://localhost:8080/path/to/file
   ```

## Database Issues

### Database Locked Errors

#### Symptoms

```
database is locked
```

or

```
SQLITE_BUSY: database is locked
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for Multiple Instances**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure only one AltMount instance is running
   ps aux | grep altmount

   # Kill any extra processes
   sudo pkill altmount
   ```

2. **Database Recovery**:

   ```bash
   # Stop AltMount
   ./altmount stop

   # Check database integrity
   sqlite3 altmount.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"

   # Repair if needed
   sqlite3 altmount.db ".backup altmount.db.backup"
   ```

3. **File System Issues**:

   ```bash
   # Check if database is on network storage
   # Move to local storage if needed
   mv altmount.db /local/storage/altmount.db

   # Update config to point to new location
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: Database diagnostic commands showing successful integrity check and repair]_

### Database Read-Only Errors

#### Symptoms

```
Error: failed to start NZB service: failed to reset stale queue items: failed to reset stale queue items: attempt to write a readonly database
```

or

```
SQLITE_READONLY: attempt to write a readonly database
```

**Solutions:**

1. **Fix Database Permissions**:

   ```bash
   # Make database writable
   chmod +w altmount.db

   # Verify permissions
   ls -la altmount.db
   # Should show: -rw-rw-rw- or similar with write permissions
   ```

2. **Check Directory Permissions**:

   ```bash
   # Ensure the directory containing the database is writable
   chmod +w /path/to/altmount/directory

   # Check directory permissions
   ls -ld /path/to/altmount/directory
   ```

3. **Docker Permission Issues**:

   ```bash
   # If running in Docker, fix ownership
   sudo chown -R 1000:1000 ./altmount.db

   # Or ensure proper PUID/PGID in docker-compose.yml
   environment:
     - PUID=1000
     - PGID=1000
   ```

4. **File System Mount Issues**:

   ```bash
   # Check if database is on a read-only filesystem
   mount | grep $(dirname $(realpath altmount.db))

   # If mounted read-only, remount as read-write
   sudo mount -o remount,rw /path/to/mount/point
   ```

_[Screenshot placeholder: Terminal showing database permission fix and successful AltMount startup]_

## Import Issues

### Imports Stuck in Processing State (Purple)

#### Symptoms

- Imports show a purple/processing status indefinitely
- Queue items never complete or fail
- System may become sluggish

**Causes:**

1. **ffprobe hanging**: Media analysis can hang on certain files, blocking the import pipeline
2. **Memory exhaustion**: Large files or many concurrent imports can exhaust system memory
3. **Container issues**: Docker containers may enter a degraded state

**Solutions:**

1. **Check for stuck ffprobe processes**:

   ```bash
   # Inside the container, check for long-running ffprobe
   docker exec <container> ps -eo pid,etime,stat,cmd | grep ffprobe

   # Kill stuck processes if found
   docker exec <container> kill <pid>
   ```

2. **Restart the container**:

   ```bash
   docker restart altmount
   ```

3. **Check system memory**:

   ```bash
   # If the system ran out of memory, imports may have been killed
   free -h
   dmesg | grep -i "out of memory"
   ```

4. **Delete and re-import**: If restarting doesn't resolve the issue, delete the stuck items from the queue via the web UI and re-send them from your ARR application.

5. **Reduce concurrent workers** to prevent future occurrences:

   ```yaml
   import:
     max_processor_workers: 1 # Reduce from default
   ```

### Symlink Paths Not Working with Docker

#### Symptoms

- Symlink directories disappear after container restart
- ARR apps can't find imported files
- Imports succeed but ARR shows "file not found"

**Solutions:**

1. **Ensure consistent volume mappings**: Both AltMount and ARR containers must see the same paths. The symlink target must resolve inside both containers:

   ```yaml
   services:
     altmount:
       volumes:
         - /data/imports:/data/imports
         - /data/media:/data/media:rshared  # rshared for FUSE mounts

     sonarr:
       volumes:
         - /data/imports:/data/imports
         - /data/media:/data/media
   ```

2. **Why symlinks disappear after restart**: Symlinks are created inside the container filesystem. If the `import_dir` is not mounted as a persistent volume, symlinks are lost on restart. Always mount `import_dir` as a Docker volume.

3. **Verify path alignment**:

   ```bash
   # Inside AltMount container, check symlink targets
   docker exec altmount ls -la /data/imports/

   # Inside ARR container, verify the target exists
   docker exec sonarr ls -la /data/media/
   ```

4. **Check `mount_path` configuration**: The `mount_path` in your config must match the path where the WebDAV/FUSE mount is visible inside the ARR container, not the host path.

## Provider Issues

### Providers Showing Offline

#### Symptoms

- Provider status shows as offline or disconnected
- Downloads fail with connection errors
- Health checks report all segments as missing

**Solutions:**

1. **Pull the latest AltMount image**:

   ```bash
   docker pull javi11/altmount:latest
   docker restart altmount
   ```

2. **Verify provider configuration**:

   ```bash
   # Test provider connectivity
   telnet <provider-host> <port>
   ```

3. **Check provider credentials**: Some providers rotate hostnames or require password resets. Verify your credentials on the provider's website.

4. **Check connection limits**: If you're running AltMount alongside other Usenet clients, you may be exceeding the provider's maximum connection limit. Reduce `max_connections` in your config.

5. **Try alternative endpoints**: Many providers offer multiple server hostnames. Switch to a different endpoint if your current one is unreachable.

## Provider Pipelining Issues

### Symptoms

- Random connection drops or timeouts during downloads
- Corrupted or incomplete segment downloads
- `480` or unexpected error responses from the provider
- Downloads work initially but fail mid-stream
- Errors like `unexpected response code` or `connection reset by peer`

**Cause:**

NNTP pipelining sends multiple requests on a single connection before waiting for responses (controlled by the `inflight_requests` setting). While this improves throughput, some providers or network configurations don't handle aggressive pipelining well — they may drop connections, return errors, or corrupt responses when too many requests are in-flight simultaneously.

**Solutions:**

1. **Disable pipelining** by setting `inflight_requests` to `1`:

   ```yaml
   providers:
     - host: "ssl-news.provider.com"
       port: 563
       username: "your_username"
       password: "your_password"
       max_connections: 20
       tls: true
       inflight_requests: 1  # Disable pipelining — one request at a time
   ```

   This is the safest and most compatible setting. It forces sequential request-response behavior on each connection, eliminating any pipelining-related issues.

2. **Gradually increase** once stable. If `inflight_requests: 1` resolves the issue, you can try increasing it gradually (e.g., `2`, `5`, `10`) to find the highest value your provider supports reliably.

3. **Compensate with more connections**. With lower `inflight_requests`, you can increase `max_connections` to maintain overall throughput. For example, switching from 20 connections with 10 inflight to 30 connections with 1 inflight may give comparable speeds with better stability.

4. **Check provider documentation**. Some providers document their pipelining support or recommended settings. Block account providers and smaller providers are more likely to have limited pipelining support.

:::tip
When reporting connection issues, always mention your `inflight_requests` value. Setting it to `1` is the first thing to try when debugging any provider-related download problem.

## Date Error When Adding a Provider

### Symptoms

- Error like `date command not supported` or `unexpected response to DATE` when saving a provider
- Provider connection test fails with a date-related error
- Some older or non-standard NNTP servers reject the ping check

**Cause:**

AltMount pings the server using the `DATE` NNTP command to verify connectivity before the connection pool is fully started. Some servers don't implement this command, causing the connection test to fail even though the server is otherwise functional.

**Solution:**

Enable **Skip server ping** in the provider settings via the web UI when editing or creating the provider, or set `skip_ping: true` in your config file:

```yaml
providers:
  - host: "ssl-news.provider.com"
    port: 563
    username: "your_username"
    password: "your_password"
    max_connections: 20
    tls: true
    skip_ping: true  # Skip DATE command ping for servers that don't support it
```

This instructs AltMount to skip the `DATE` ping on startup for that provider. The provider will still be used normally for all downloads; only the initial handshake ping is skipped.

## Logging and Debugging

### Enable Debug Logging

For detailed troubleshooting, enable debug logging:

```yaml
log:
  level: "debug"
  file: "/var/log/altmount/debug.log"
  max_size: 100
  max_backups: 5
```

### Useful Debug Commands

```bash
# Real-time log monitoring
tail -f /var/log/altmount/altmount.log

# Search for specific errors
grep -i "error" /var/log/altmount/altmount.log

# Check recent entries
journalctl -u altmount -f --since "1 hour ago"

# API health check
curl -u user:pass http://localhost:8080/api/health/detailed | jq .

# Test WebDAV directly
curl -I -u user:pass http://localhost:8080/

# Provider connection test
curl -u user:pass http://localhost:8080/api/providers/provider-name/test
```
