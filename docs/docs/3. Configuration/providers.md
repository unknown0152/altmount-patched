# NNTP Providers Configuration

NNTP providers are the backbone of AltMount - they provide access to Usenet newsgroups for downloading content. This guide covers configuring multiple providers for optimal performance and reliability.

## Overview

AltMount supports multiple NNTP providers with automatic failover and load balancing. You can add as many providers as you want for maximum reliability and performance. Having multiple providers ensures:

- **Redundancy**: If one provider is down, others continue working
- **Load Distribution**: Downloads spread across providers for better performance
- **Missing Article Recovery**: When articles are missing, all other providers are automatically checked
- **Backup Provider Strategy**: Designated backup providers only used when primary providers fail
- **Content Completion**: Different providers may have different retention and content availability

## Basic Provider Configuration

### Provider Configuration via Web Interface

Configure NNTP providers through the AltMount web interface:

### Adding a New Provider

To add a new NNTP provider, click the "Add Provider" button:

![Add Provider Dialog](/images/config-provider-add-modal.png)
_Provider configuration dialog showing all available settings_

**Required Fields:**

- **Host**: Your provider's server hostname
- **Port**: Usually 563 (SSL) or 119 (unencrypted)
- **Username**: Your account username
- **Password**: Your account password
- **Max Connections**: Number of concurrent connections (typically 10-50)

**Optional Fields:**

- **Use TLS/SSL encryption**: Recommended for security
- **Skip TLS certificate verification**: Only use if provider has certificate issues
- **Use only as backup provider**: Configure as backup/fallback provider
- **Inflight Requests**: Number of pipelined requests per connection (see [Pipelining](#inflight-requests-pipelining))
- **Proxy URL**: Route traffic through a proxy server
- **Enabled**: Toggle provider on/off without removing configuration

**Backup Provider Strategy:**

The "Use only as backup provider" option is crucial for building resilient provider configurations:

- **Primary Providers**: Fast, unlimited providers used for regular downloads
- **Backup Providers**: Only activated when primary providers fail or missing articles
- **Automatic Failover**: Missing articles trigger automatic backup provider usage
- **Cost Optimization**: Use expensive/limited providers only when needed

### Inflight Requests (Pipelining)

The `inflight_requests` parameter controls **NNTP pipelining** — the number of requests that can be sent on a single TCP connection _before_ waiting for the server's responses.

**How it works:**

Without pipelining, each NNTP command follows a strict request-response cycle: send a command, wait for the full response, then send the next command. Each round-trip adds network latency, which limits throughput — especially on high-latency connections.

With pipelining enabled (`inflight_requests` > 1), AltMount sends multiple NNTP commands (e.g., `BODY` requests to download article segments) on the same connection without waiting for each response. The server processes and responds to them in order, and AltMount reads the responses as they arrive. This hides network latency and significantly improves download throughput.

| Value | Behavior                                                                                               | Use Case                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `1`   | Sequential mode — one request at a time per connection. Most conservative and compatible.              | Troubleshooting connection issues, or providers that don't support pipelining well |
| `10`  | (Default) Send up to 10 requests before waiting for a response. Good balance of speed and reliability. | Most providers                                                                     |
| `20`  | Aggressive pipelining for maximum throughput on high-latency connections.                              | High-latency providers with good pipelining support                                |

**Example:**

```yaml
providers:
  - host: "ssl-news.provider.com"
    port: 563
    username: "your_username"
    password: "your_password"
    max_connections: 20
    tls: true
    inflight_requests: 10 # Default — good for most providers
```

:::tip
If you experience connection drops, timeouts, corrupted downloads, or `480` errors from your provider, try setting `inflight_requests: 1` to disable pipelining. This is the safest setting and helps isolate whether pipelining is causing the issue. See the [Troubleshooting Guide](../5.%20Troubleshooting/common-issues.md#provider-pipelining-issues) for more details.

Each provider is assigned an auto-generated `id` field. You do not set a provider name — providers are identified by their host and configuration.

### YAML Example

```yaml
providers:
  # Primary provider with SSL
  - host: "ssl-news.provider.com"
    port: 563
    username: "your_username"
    password: "your_password"
    max_connections: 20
    tls: true

  # Backup provider
  - host: "backup.provider.com"
    port: 563
    username: "backup_username"
    password: "backup_password"
    max_connections: 10
    tls: true
    is_backup_provider: true
```

## Connection Types

### SSL/TLS Connections (Recommended)

![Security Options](/images/config-provider-add-modal.png)
_Security options in the provider configuration dialog_

**Security Recommendations:**

1. **Use TLS/SSL encryption**: ✅ Always enable for security
   - Encrypts all data between AltMount and your provider
   - Protects your credentials and download activity
   - Standard on port 563

2. **Skip TLS certificate verification**: ⚠️ Use with caution
   - Only enable if provider has certificate issues
   - Creates security risk by allowing man-in-the-middle attacks
   - Try to resolve certificate issues with provider first

**Benefits of SSL/TLS:**

- Encrypted connection protects your credentials
- Prevents ISP throttling and monitoring
- Required by most modern providers

## Performance Optimization

### Connection Limits

Set the "Max Connections" field based on your provider's limits and your bandwidth:

![Connection Settings](/images/config-provider-add-modal.png)
_Max Connections setting in the provider configuration_

**Guidelines**:

- **Total across all providers**: Don't exceed your bandwidth capacity

### Provider Priority and Backup Strategy

AltMount automatically manages provider selection with intelligent failover:

**Primary Provider Selection:**

- **Provider order** = First configured providers are preferred
- **Connection availability** = Providers with available connections are preferred

**Backup Provider Usage:**

- **Backup providers** = Only used when primary providers fail or lack articles
- **Missing article recovery** = All providers (including backups) checked for missing content
- **Automatic failover** = Seamless switching when primary providers unavailable

**Strategic Configuration:**

- **Primary (unlimited)**: 20-50 connections, backup=false
- **Secondary (unlimited, different backbone)**: 15-30 connections, backup=false
- **Backup (block/limited)**: 5-15 connections, backup=true
- **Specialty (European/retention)**: 10-20 connections, backup=true (for specific content)

## Testing and Validation

### Connection Testing

After configuring providers, test the connections:

1. **Start AltMount** with your configuration
2. **Check the logs** for connection status
3. **Use the web interface** to verify provider status

### Troubleshooting Connection Issues

#### Authentication Failures

```
ERROR Provider authentication failed
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify username and password are correct
- Check if your account is active and not suspended
- Ensure you're not exceeding connection limits

#### SSL/TLS Issues

```
ERROR Provider TLS handshake failed
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify the provider supports SSL on the specified port
- Try with `insecure_tls: true` temporarily for debugging
- Check if firewall is blocking the connection

#### Connection Limits

```
WARN Provider max connections reached (480 errors)
```

**Solutions**:

- Reduce `max_connections` for that provider
- Check provider's connection limits
- Ensure you're not running multiple clients with the same account

#### DNS/Network Issues

```
ERROR Provider failed to resolve host
```

**Solutions**:

- Verify the hostname is correct
- Test DNS resolution: `nslookup ssl-news.provider.com`
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings
