# ARR Integration

AltMount acts as a SABnzbd-compatible download client for Sonarr and Radarr. This guide walks through the full setup process for seamless integration with your media management applications.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring ARR integration, make sure the following are in place:

1. **SABnzbd compatibility enabled** -- set `sabnzbd.enabled: true` in your config
2. **ARRs service enabled** -- set `arrs.enabled: true`
3. **At least one NNTP provider configured** -- AltMount needs a working Usenet connection

## Step 1: Configure SABnzbd Categories

Set up categories in your AltMount config that match your ARR setup. Each category needs a `type` field indicating which ARR it belongs to:

```yaml
sabnzbd:
  enabled: true
  categories:
    - name: movies
      type: radarr
    - name: tv
      type: sonarr
```

The category names should match what you configure in Sonarr/Radarr as the download client category.

## Step 2: Add ARR Instances

Navigate to the ARR settings page in the AltMount web UI. Add each Sonarr and Radarr instance with:

![ARR integration settings showing Radarr/Sonarr instance configuration](/images/config-arrs.png)

- **Instance URL** -- the full URL of your Sonarr/Radarr instance (e.g., `http://sonarr:8989`)
- **API key** -- found in Sonarr/Radarr under Settings > General

## Step 3: Register as Download Client

AltMount can automatically register itself as a SABnzbd download client in your Sonarr/Radarr instances.

**Via the web UI:** Click the "Register Download Client" button on the ARR settings page.

**Via API:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/arrs/download-client/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

This tells Sonarr/Radarr to send NZBs to AltMount using the SABnzbd API protocol.

## Step 4: Register Webhooks

Webhooks enable instant import notifications. When a download completes, Sonarr/Radarr is notified immediately instead of waiting for the next polling cycle.

**Via the web UI:** Click "Register Webhooks" on the ARR settings page.

**Via API:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/arrs/webhook/register \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Step 5: Configure Import Strategy

AltMount supports three import strategies. Choose the one that best fits your setup:

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| How it works      | Media accessed directly via WebDAV/FUSE mount          | Creates symlinks in an import directory                                                                       | Creates `.strm` files pointing to WebDAV URLs                                                                   |
| ARR integration   | ARR reads directly from mount                          | ARR imports from symlink directory                                                                            | ARR imports `.strm` files                                                                                       |
| Docker setup      | Simplest — only mount path needed                      | Requires shared volumes for import dir + mount                                                                | Requires shared volume for STRM output dir                                                                      |
| Best for          | Simple setups without no debrid program like dechyparr | Most ARR setups (recommended)                                                                                 | Emby/Jellyfin full stream speed                                                                                 |
| File management   | Files managed through AltMount only                    | ARR manages library, AltMount manages metadata                                                                | Player resolves `.strm` URL at playback time                                                                    |
| Health monitoring | Metadata-only sync (fast)                              | Full sync with library directory                                                                              | Full sync with library directory                                                                                |
| Limitations       | Slower arr imports due to the need of mount refreshing | Symlinks can become broken when the original file is replaced if health monitoring is not properly configured | STRM files can become broken when the original file is replaced if health monitoring is not properly configured |

### Recommended: SYMLINK Strategy

For ARR integration, the **SYMLINK** import strategy is recommended. This creates symlinks in an import directory that your ARR apps can access.

```yaml
# Root-level mount path (NOT inside import section)
mount_path: /mnt/remotes/altmount
import:
  import_strategy: SYMLINK
  import_dir: /mnt/symlinks/altmount
```

- `mount_path` -- **root-level config field** — the path where the WebDAV/FUSE content is mounted, as seen by the ARR apps
- `import_dir` -- the directory where AltMount creates symlinks for completed downloads. Must be accessible by Sonarr/Radarr

> **Note:** `mount_path` is a root-level configuration field, not nested inside `import`. Both AltMount and your ARR apps must be able to reach `import_dir` and `mount_path`. In Docker, this typically means shared volumes.

### NONE (Direct Access) Strategy

Use this when you don't need ARR integration or prefer to access files directly through the WebDAV/FUSE mount:

```yaml
import:
  import_strategy: NONE
```

No `import_dir` or `mount_path` is needed. Media is accessed directly via the mount point.

### STRM Strategy

Creates `.strm` files that contain WebDAV URLs. Useful when your media player can resolve HTTP URLs directly:

```yaml
# Replace with your actual AltMount hostname/port if changed
mount_path: http://altmount:8080

import:
  import_strategy: STRM
  import_dir: /mnt/strm/altmount
```

### Example Docker Volume Setup (SYMLINK)

```yaml
services:
  altmount:
    volumes:
      - /mnt/mnt:rshared

  sonarr:
    volumes:
      - /mnt/mnt
```

With this layout, both containers see the same paths, so `import_dir: /mnt/symlinks/altmount` and `mount_path: /mnt/remotes/altmount` will work correctly.

### Common Import Strategy Issues

- **Symlinks failing**: Ensure both `import_dir` and `mount_path` resolve to valid paths inside all containers. If symlinks point to paths that don't exist inside the ARR container, imports will fail silently.
- **Extra path segments** (e.g., `../complete/..` appearing in paths): This usually means `mount_path` doesn't match the actual mount point inside the container. Double-check your Docker volume mappings.
- **STRM files not playing**: The WebDAV URL in the `.strm` file must be reachable from the media player. If using Docker, ensure the player can reach AltMount's hostname and port.

## Step 6: Configure Queue Cleanup

AltMount can automatically monitor ARR queues and remove failed imports to keep things tidy:

```yaml
arrs:
  enabled: true
  webhook_base_url: "" # Base URL for webhook callbacks (defaults to http://<host>:<port>)
  queue_cleanup_enabled: true
  queue_cleanup_interval_seconds: 300
  queue_cleanup_grace_period_minutes: 10 # Wait before cleaning up (default: 10)
  cleanup_automatic_import_failure: true
  queue_cleanup_allowlist:
    - message: "Not a Custom Format upgrade"
      enabled: true
    - message: "No files found are eligible"
      enabled: true
```

| Field                                | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue_cleanup_enabled`              | Enable or disable automatic queue cleanup                                                               |
| `queue_cleanup_interval_seconds`     | How often to check ARR queues (in seconds)                                                              |
| `queue_cleanup_grace_period_minutes` | Minimum age (in minutes) before a failed item is cleaned up (default: 10)                               |
| `cleanup_automatic_import_failure`   | Clean up items with "Automatic import is not possible" errors                                           |
| `webhook_base_url`                   | Base URL ARRs use to reach AltMount for webhooks (default: `http://<host>:<port>`)                      |
| `queue_cleanup_allowlist`            | Error messages to treat as safe for cleanup. Each entry has a `message` string and an `enabled` boolean |

## Verifying the Setup

After completing the steps above:

1. Send a test NZB from Sonarr or Radarr to AltMount
2. Check the AltMount queue page to confirm the NZB was received
3. Once processed, verify that Sonarr/Radarr picks up the import via webhook

You can also check the integration health via API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/api/arrs/health \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Download Client Test Fails

If the connection test in Sonarr/Radarr fails:

1. **Verify network connectivity** between ARR and AltMount containers
2. **Check SABnzbd API is enabled** in AltMount config
3. **Confirm the host and port** match your AltMount instance
4. **Check firewall rules** if running on separate hosts

### Imports Not Detected

If Sonarr/Radarr doesn't detect completed downloads:

1. **Verify webhooks are registered** -- check ARR Settings > Connect
2. **Check import paths** -- `import_dir` and `mount_path` must be accessible to ARR
3. **Review ARR logs** for import errors
4. **Test manual import** from ARR to verify path configuration

### Queue Cleanup Issues

If queue cleanup isn't working as expected:

1. **Verify ARR instances are configured** with valid API keys
2. **Check cleanup interval** isn't too frequent (recommended: 300+ seconds)
3. **Review allowlist** to ensure error messages match exactly
4. **Monitor ARR logs** for API communication issues

## Next Steps

With ARR integration configured:

1. **[Configure Health Monitoring](health-monitoring.md)** - Enable automatic repair for corrupted files
2. **[Troubleshooting](../5.%20Troubleshooting/common-issues.md)** - Resolve integration issues

ARR integration enables fully automated media management with AltMount acting as your primary download client. Combined with health monitoring, you can achieve a self-healing media collection that automatically repairs corruption and maintains high availability.
